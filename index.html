        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I’m a student from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, currently pursuing an engineering degree in Computer Science with a focus on IoT and Blockchain at BBD University, Lucknow. My early education was at Kendriya Vidyalaya, S.G.P.G.I.M.S, Lucknow, where I was passionate about sports like cricket, football, and kabaddi, and even won a silver medal in the regional sports meet for kabaddi. I achieved 89.4% in my X board exams and 91.6% in XII.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interest in computers sparked after high school when I started learning programming with Python. This enthusiasm grew as I entered BBD University, where I’ve explored various technologies. My skills now include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Programming Languages</strong>: Python, Java, C</li>
            <li><strong>Web Technologies</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
            <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib</li>
            <li><strong>Database</strong>: MySQL</li>
            <li><strong>Tools & Platforms</strong>: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, Postman</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I’m always eager to learn and dive into new technologies. I love meeting new people and working in teams. During my time at college, I volunteered with the cultural tech team for our annual fest and was a part of the college society AAINA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coming from a middle-class joint family, I understand that growth takes time and effort—good things are worth the wait.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting with you!

            <p>My Currency Converter is a straightforward web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses currency values from a GitHub repository to convert different currencies. Hosted on GitHub Pages, this tool offers a quick and easy way to perform currency conversions without relying on real-time exchange rates.</p>

            <p>Our team, Coding Dragons, participated in a hackathon organized by ISRO in collaboration with Hack2skill, where we developed an innovative voice-enabled web map interface aimed at enhancing user interaction and accessibility. Our project integrates the SpeechKITT library, allowing users to control the map using voice commands for various tasks such as searching for locations, toggling map layers, placing markers, and navigating. This feature-rich solution uses the Leaflet GIS library to efficiently manage and display geospatial data, providing users with dynamic and interactive experiences.</p>
            <p>To offer detailed visualizations, we incorporated WMS layers from Bhuvan and Bhoonidhi, enabling the display of glaciers, lake water bodies, and satellite views through Google Maps. The backend is built using Python and Flask, ensuring scalability and reliability, while the frontend leverages JavaScript and Leaflet for a responsive and user-friendly interface. Additionally, we enhanced accessibility by integrating UserWay's Accessibility Menu, which allows users to adjust features like contrast, alignment, and saturation to suit their needs.</p>
            <p>Our solution stands out for its use of the SpeechKITT library by annyang, which offers faster and more stable voice command recognition compared to other speech-to-text solutions. This voice-enabled mapping system provides an innovative and efficient tool for interacting with geospatial data, making it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
